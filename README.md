This project is my first JS site.
It is a full front-end landing page for an Israeli appraisal; therefore, the content is in Hebrew.

Both the design and the coding are my work.

Includes:

* a modal pop up with a good recommendation triggered once by scrolling over the welcome heading.
* a simple search feature to easily find relevant content.
* some nice texting effect triggered by the down arrow button in the recommendations section.

The site is responsive and runs well on both Android and IOS devices.
